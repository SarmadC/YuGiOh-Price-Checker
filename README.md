### YuGiOh-Price-Checker
#### Populate Excel Files with the price data of your YuGiOh Cards using print tags

#### What the program does?
This program will allow you to check the price of your YuGiOh cards by using print tags.

The goal is to be able to create stunning visualization of your card collection that is unique to you
and updates in real time. I was somewhat successful in doing this by importing the dataset created by the API into
PowerBI and creating a dashboard. Another feature I want to implement is the ability to preview a card within the excel sheet by hovering over it. 


#### How was the program created?
The program was created in Python using the YGO prices API.

#### Why YGO Prices API?
The reason YGO prices API was used is that it is free and does not require an access to a private key compared to the TCG Player API
One of the many challenges for me was learning how to use APIs for the first time and implementing it with Python
